# VSM Security Protocol Integration

This document proves that VSM Security fully integrates with the VSM ecosystem and implements the VSM protocol correctly.

## Protocol Implementation

### 1. Security Event Types

VSM Security defines three protocol message types:

```elixir
@security_event_type "vsm.security.event"    # General security events
@security_alert_type "vsm.security.alert"    # Critical alerts via algedonic
@security_metric_type "vsm.security.metric"  # Metrics for variety management
```

### 2. VSM Channels

#### Temporal Variety Channel
Used for normal security operations:
- Authentication events
- Access control decisions  
- Policy updates
- Zone transitions

#### Algedonic Channel
Used for critical security events that bypass hierarchy:
- Breach detection
- DDoS attacks
- Zombie/botnet detection
- Critical vulnerabilities

### 3. Command Handling

VSM Core can send these commands to Security:

| Command | Purpose | Parameters |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `security.scan` | Scan zones for threats | zones: list of zones |
| `security.quarantine` | Isolate compromised entities | type, id |
| `security.update_policy` | Update security policies | zone, policy, value |

### 4. Variety Metrics

Security provides these metrics for VSM optimization:

```elixir
%{
  threat_level: :low | :medium | :high | :critical,
  active_zones: [:public, :dmz, :private],
  neural_accuracy: float(),  # ML model accuracy
  blocked_threats: integer(),
  auth_failures: integer(),
  variety_score: float()     # Shannon entropy of events
}
```

## Integration Points

### With VSM Core
- **Registration**: Security registers as a subsystem with capabilities
- **Commands**: Receives and executes security commands
- **Channels**: Uses both temporal variety and algedonic channels

### With VSM Telemetry
- **Monitoring**: Analyzes telemetry for security anomalies
- **Metrics**: Provides security metrics for system optimization

### With VSM Event Bus
- **Subscriptions**: Monitors security-relevant topics
  - `system.anomaly`
  - `network.intrusion`
  - `auth.failure`
  - `rate_limit.exceeded`
- **Publishing**: Publishes security events for other subsystems

### With VSM Connections
- **Traffic Analysis**: Monitors network connections for threats
- **Zone Enforcement**: Validates connection zone transitions

## Zone Mapping to VSM Model

```
S5 (Strategic)    → Algedonic alerts, strategic security decisions
S4 (Intelligence) → Neural networks, threat prediction, ML models  
S3 (Control)      → Zone management, policies, authentication
S2 (Coordination) → Zone routing, load balancing, coordination
S1 (Operations)   → Public/DMZ/Private zones, actual enforcement
```

## Protocol Message Flow

### Normal Security Event
```
1. Event occurs (e.g., failed login)
2. VSMIntegration.send_security_event(:auth_failure, payload)
3. Message sent via Temporal Variety channel to S3.auth
4. Event published to Event Bus
5. Metrics updated for variety calculation
```

### Critical Security Alert
```
1. Critical threat detected (e.g., breach)
2. VSMIntegration.send_security_event(:breach_detected, payload)
3. Algedonic signal sent (bypass_hierarchy: true)
4. S5 receives immediate alert
5. Emergency response initiated
```

## Testing the Integration

Run the integration tests:
```bash
mix test test/integration/vsm_ecosystem_test.exs
```

Run the protocol demo:
```bash
elixir demo/vsm_protocol_demo.exs
```

## Protocol Compliance

✅ **Message Types**: All three security message types implemented
✅ **Channels**: Both temporal variety and algedonic channels used
✅ **Commands**: Handles all security commands from VSM Core
✅ **Variety**: Provides metrics for variety management
✅ **Registration**: Properly registers with VSM Core
✅ **Events**: Subscribes to and publishes relevant events
✅ **Zones**: Implements VSM hierarchical structure

## Conclusion

VSM Security is fully integrated with the VSM protocol and ecosystem. It:
- Implements all required protocol message types
- Uses appropriate channels for different event types
- Handles commands from VSM Core
- Provides variety metrics for optimization
- Integrates with all VSM ecosystem components
- Maps security zones to VSM's recursive structure

# VSM Security Test Suite

## Overview

This comprehensive security test suite validates the VSM Security system's ability to detect, prevent, and respond to various security threats. The suite covers penetration testing, zombie/botnet detection, performance benchmarks, and full-stack integration testing.

## Test Categories

### 1. Penetration Testing (`penetration/`)

Tests the system's resilience against various attack vectors:

- **Zone Boundary Tests**: Validates zone isolation and access control
- **Authentication Bypass**: Tests against token replay, session hijacking
- **Neural Network Poisoning**: Adversarial input detection
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory and CPU DoS prevention
- **Fuzzing**: Malformed input handling

### 2. Zombie Detection (`zombie_detection/`)

Comprehensive botnet and zombie detection capabilities:

- **C&C Communication**: Command and control pattern detection
- **DDoS Participation**: Identifies nodes participating in attacks
- **Lateral Movement**: Detects infection spreading patterns
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: Sudden behavior changes, dormant bot activation
- **Neural Detection**: Ensemble models, online learning, evasion resistance

### 3. Performance Benchmarks (`performance/`)

Ensures security features meet performance requirements:

- **Bloom Filter Performance**: Insertion rates, lookup speed, memory efficiency
- **Neural Network Inference**: Latency, throughput, model optimization
- **Zone Routing**: Decision latency, concurrent scalability, caching
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Full security check performance

### 4. Integration Testing (`integration/`)

Full-stack security validation:

- **Complete Security Pipeline**: User flow from connection to response
- **Attack Progression**: Escalating defenses against multi-phase attacks
- **Coordinated Attacks**: Botnet simulation with distributed actors
- **Cross-Component Integration**: Bloom filters + neural networks
- **Security Metrics**: Real-time monitoring and correlation

## Running the Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
mix test test/security/
```

### Run Specific Category
```bash
# Penetration tests only
mix test test/security/penetration/

# Performance benchmarks
mix test test/security/performance/ --include benchmark

# Integration tests
mix test test/security/integration/ --include integration
```

### Using the Test Runner
```elixir
# Run all security tests
VSM.Security.TestRunner.run_all()

# Run specific category
VSM.Security.TestRunner.run_category(:penetration)

# Run with options
VSM.Security.TestRunner.run_all(include: [:benchmark], exclude: [:slow])

# Run security scenarios
VSM.Security.TestRunner.run_security_scenarios()
```

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Zone Boundary Violation Test
Tests unauthorized cross-zone access attempts:
```elixir
test "unauthorized cross-zone access attempt" do
  # Creates secure and restricted zones
  # Attempts access from lower to higher privilege zone
  # Verifies access is blocked and alerts are generated
end
```

### 2. Botnet Detection Test
Identifies coordinated malicious behavior:
```elixir
test "command and control communication detection" do
  # Simulates C&C patterns (beacons, DNS tunneling)
  # Uses neural network for pattern recognition
  # Validates detection confidence > 80%
end
```

### 3. Performance Benchmark Test
Ensures security doesn't compromise performance:
```elixir
test "high-volume traffic analysis" do
  # Processes 10,000 requests
  # Measures throughput > 1000 req/sec
  # Validates processing time < 5 seconds
end
```

### 4. Adaptive Attack Test
Tests against sophisticated evasion techniques:
```elixir
test "adaptive attack with evasion techniques" do
  # Multi-phase attack with IP rotation
  # Rate limiting evasion
  # Verifies defense escalation
end
```

## Performance Requirements

The security system must meet these performance targets:

- **Bloom Filter**: 
  - Insertion: > 10,000 items/second
  - Lookup: > 100,000 queries/second
  - False positive rate: < 5%

- **Neural Network**:
  - Inference latency: < 10ms (P99)
  - Batch throughput: > 10,000 samples/second
  - Model size: < 100MB

- **Zone Routing**:
  - Decision latency: < 1ms average
  - Concurrent requests: > 10,000/second
  - Cache hit rate: > 80%

- **End-to-End Pipeline**:
  - Request processing: > 1,000 req/second
  - Average latency: < 5ms
  - Security effectiveness: > 80% threat blocking

## Security Metrics

The test suite tracks these key security metrics:

1. **Detection Accuracy**
   - True positive rate
   - False positive rate
   - Detection confidence scores

2. **Response Time**
   - Time to detect threats
   - Time to activate defenses
   - Alert generation latency

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory consumption under load
   - CPU utilization during attacks
   - Network bandwidth usage

4. **Attack Mitigation**
   - Percentage of attacks blocked
   - Defense escalation effectiveness
   - Recovery time after attacks

## Test Data

The suite uses various test data patterns:

- **IP Addresses**: Randomly generated, botnet patterns
- **Attack Patterns**: C&C beacons, DDoS, lateral movement
- **User Behavior**: Normal, suspicious, malicious
- **Payloads**: Benign, malformed, exploit attempts

## Continuous Integration

Add to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
test:security:
  stage: test
  script:
    - mix deps.get
    - mix compile
    - mix test test/security/ --cover
  coverage: '/\d+.\d+% \| Total/'
  artifacts:
    reports:
      coverage: cover/
```

## Extending the Test Suite

To add new security tests:

1. Choose appropriate category directory
2. Create test module following naming convention
3. Include relevant tags (`:benchmark`, `:integration`)
4. Add to `TestRunner` module registry
5. Document test scenarios and requirements

## Security Test Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Run security tests in isolated environment
2. **Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup of test data
3. **Timing**: Account for timing-sensitive security features
4. **Concurrency**: Test under concurrent load
5. **Monitoring**: Capture security events during tests
